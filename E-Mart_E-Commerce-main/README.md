This project deals with developing an e-commerce website exclusively for selling electronic items online. 
It provides the user with a catalog of different devices available for purchase with their images, price, description and reviews. 
In order to facilitate online purchase, a shopping cart is provided to the user.
The user can add items to the cart and proceed to checkout.
